## Novemeber Review
A lot of work with enemies has been completed. SOme things that need to get done ar
* Bosses at end of level
* Pizza health increase
* Added more sounds
* More levels

It might seem like a lot of work but all the hard work has been completed. Now I just need to bulk up current scripts to add the ability to increase health such as reverting the enemy damage script and adding it to a pizza png object.
More levles involves finishing current challanges anf moveing them to the new level.

December I will add these features and bug test the game before submission.
